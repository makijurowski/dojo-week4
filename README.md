# At the Dojo...

## Training Week 4

__Rose:__ This past week, I started to feel more comfortable with objects as an abstract construct, which has helped a lot during algorithms and while working on the projects across  different frameworks. The Wall was challenging, but I really enjoyed working on the assignment and I'm eager to refactor it with a list of improvements I already have in mind. Alan's lectures are fun and informative!

__Bud:__ I'm eager to learn Django and gain a better understanding of OOP principles along with how the MVC pattern operates. Test driven development intimidates me! I just want to make pretty things and play with numbers.

__Thorn:__ Sometimes the material got dense this week, or what was covered in class wasn't enough to gain a working understanding for me to follow along with the assignments meaningfullt. After spending much of Saturday struggling to access the platform and get a Django app up and running, I finally hopped over to the Django Girls tutorial (<https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/>) and had a blog hosted within ~15 minutes! From here, visualizing the file structure and overall project setup has been much easier than the platform's equivalent assignments. I could use help in the form of  receiving more feedback on the code I'm writing and more opportunities to see multiple examples of ways to solve a problem.
