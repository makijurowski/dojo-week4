# At the Dojo...

## Training Week 4

__Rose:__ This past week, I started to feel more comfortable with objects as an abstract construct, which has helped a lot during algorithms and while working on the projects across  different frameworks. The Wall was challenging, but I really enjoyed working on the assignment and I'm eager to refactor it with a list of improvements I already have in mind. Alan's lectures are fun and informative!

__Bud:__ I'm excited to learn Django and gain a better understanding of OOP principles along with how the MVC pattern operates in practice. Trying to re-think everything from a test-driven development mindset intimidates me! My instinct is still to make things pretty and find new ways to play with numbers. I could use help next week in the form of receiving more feedback on the code I'm writing and more opportunities to see multiple solutions to a given problem.

__Thorn:__ At different points, I didn't feel I had enough time to process the dense material this week, or what was covered in class wasn't enough for me to follow along with the assignments. After spending much of Saturday struggling to access the learning platform and get a Django app up and running, I finally hopped over to the Django Girls tutorial (<https://tutorial.djangogirls.org>) and had a blog hosted within ~15 minutes! From there, visualizing the file structure and overall project setup is proving to be a much simpler task than trying to accomplish the same through the Dojo's equivalent guides.  Also, why is writing working jQuery still such a challenge?!
